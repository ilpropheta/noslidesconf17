# Competitive Programming for fun and self-improvement

Material and examples of my NoSlidesConf17 hands-on session (Nov 25 2017 - Bologna).

## Retrospective

Solving a problem is not an end, instead, it's the beginning of several **opportunities** for self-improvement. 
How? Thinking more in deep about the problem and the solution(s) you developed, asking yourself questions, looking for patterns, playing with constraints, etc.
Asking questions is often more important than developing the solution.
Or simply: **retrospective**.

Some retrospective **questions**:
* what if your **constraints** change (e.g. the input grows a lot)?
* what if the input has particular **properties** (e.g. it is sorted)?
* can you find (and combine) **patterns** to solve this problem (e.g. fold/reduce)?
* what if the **data types** change (e.g. big integers)?
* what if some **constants** of the problem turn into **variables**?

Some retrospective **constraints/objectives** you can establish on the problem:
* make your input very big and very tiny
* remove all for loops / use only standard library functions/constructs
* don't allocate extra space
* solve a problem in $YourTargetTimeComplexity time and $YourTargetSpaceComplexity space
* change paradigm
* solve the problem in terms of another thing (e.g. queue using two stacks)
* use only $TheOnlyThingToUse (e.g. functions, objects)
* disable some operations (e.g. division)
